# Drag-Drop
Drag and drop is a user interface (UI) interaction that allows users to move objects between different areas on the screen by clicking and holding the object, dragging it to the new location, and releasing the mouse button to drop it into the new location. This interaction can be used to perform a variety of tasks, such as moving files or images between folders, reordering items in a list, or adding items to a shopping cart.
